A part of your brain changes into this survival mode right when the diagnosis occurs because you have to be prepared for it. When you think of cancer, a lot of time the outcome is death."</p>

And it always sort of felt weird to hate cancer because it killed someone you hated. That it had been a direct accomplice in denying you closure in some sense. Because I mean, I don't know if I would have ever come to the point of confrontation, but I would have at least had the option had cancer not taken my grandfather from this world, right? And vocalizing that to people feels strange. </p>

A girl texted me and said it helped her in the way that she thinks about her and her dad's relationship and that she wants to be on better terms with him. Even just that made it all worth it. Then we trained and we trained and we trained and we talked about people that we rode for.

It’s so important to find a sense of purpose, or else you feel like you can’t do anything. With Texas 4000, I felt like I actually had joined the fight and was doing something about it. It gave me something, a lot of hope and other people to talk to and share my story. I genuinely appreciate all my friends and the people on this team, and what they’ve done for me so far.

            <p class="atext">	Me, personally not so much because I get it. It’s definitely uncomfortable. You don’t know some of things people are going through or how to react. To me, it’s fine. It’s just always a little awkward because I don’t want them to feel awkward or uncomfortable especially when you’re meeting someone for the first time and they ask, “What does your dad do?” and you’re like, “actually…” It’s weird, I was talking to my counselor about this. She was saying how it’s ok to give yourself time to think about it and take the time to cry, because my biggest thing is I just would never give myself enough time specifically to actually sit down and think about my dad and everything that had happened. Even with T4K, it was different. That whole thing was its own thing but it helped me with my own process. It’s going to be my whole life.
	Coping is definitely very different. Sometimes there are moments now, even when I’m talking to you right now that I feel fine about it. And then there are other days where someone will just mention something and I’ll start immediately crying and wonder what’s going on. Some days are easier than others and some people are just more comfortable to talk with and easier to be vulnerable with. </p>

Just say, "Hey, I'm here and I'm listening and I can give you and hug. I don't know what you're going through but I'm with you" and I think he gets that, which he probably wouldn't have before.

That's what I loved most, is coming home from a tough day at school or being stressed out, I'd get a hug from my dad. That was the thing that I missed the most, was his hugs. Over the last few years, whenever I feel worn out or vulnerable or in need of a hug, that's when I miss him the most. I've got a couple friends that give really good hugs that remind me of my dad. It's the little things that remind you that are very unique to the relationship that I had.

It's just what you do with that time and how you live in that time that you experience life. I don't know. I, it's ... Sometimes I forget that it's been like 4 or 5 years, because sometimes it feels like it was just yesterday. Sometimes it feels like it might have been longer ago.
